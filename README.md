# Bayesian-modeling-Maximum-entropy-model-Neural-feature-function
In my own independent scientific research experience, I used the neural feature function of the Bayesian modeling maximum entropy model to verify its advantages in small samples and noisy labels, but the effect was not good, which needs to be solved in subsequent research.
